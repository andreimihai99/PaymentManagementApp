I created this Payment Management App with the purpose of helping people in, as the name says, managing their payments and bills.
This is quite a simple application and was made with the sole purpose of developing my Java skills.

I've created two use cases, Customer and Admin. Both the customer and admin must create personal accounts in order to enter the app. They will be able to login by entering their unique username and password.
The Admin can:

    -> see a list with every customer in the database(name, surname and the bills they have to pay).
    -> enter the add amounts page where multiple features can be used:
          -> display information about a specific customer(searched by username).
          -> add new bill amounts to a customer(electricity, gas, etc.).
          -> go back to the admin main page.
The Customer can:

    -> see how many bills they have to pay and their respective values.
    -> pay all the bills.
    -> choose to pay only a certain part of the bills, by pressing a button near each respective field(electricity, gas, etc.).
